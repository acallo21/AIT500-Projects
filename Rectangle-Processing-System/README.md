# Rectangle Processing System

## Description
This Java program allows users to **create, modify, and compare rectangles**. The system ensures that the width and height **fall within a valid range**, and it provides functionality to **calculate area, perimeter, and sort rectangles based on their size**.

## Features
- Creates and stores **rectangle objects**  
- Ensures **valid dimensions** (width and height must be between 0.1 and 20.0)  
- Calculates **area and perimeter**  
- Implements a **comparator to sort rectangles by area**  
- Includes a test suite with **validation cases and sorting functionality**  

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/acallo21/AIT500-Projects.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:  
   ```sh
   cd AIT500-Projects/Rectangle-Processing-System
   ```
3. Open the project in **Eclipse** or any Java IDE.  
4. Run the **`RectangleTest.java`** file to test rectangle creation and validation.  
5. Run the **`RectangleSortTest.java`** file to test rectangle sorting.  

## Example Output
```

Perimeter: 19.8
Area: 24.44

Rectangle 2: Width: 10.5, Height: 8.1
Perimeter: 37.2
Area: 85.05

Test Setter Methods:
Rectangle 3: Width: 6.0, Height: 4.0
Rectangle 3: Width: 6.0, Height: 7.0

Testing Error Conditions:
An exception occurred in Rectangle 4: Width must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 20
An exception occurred in Rectangle 5: Height must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 20
An exception occurred in Rectangle 6: Width must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 20

Sorted Areas:

# Gas Mileage Calculator

## Description
This Java program calculates **miles per gallon (MPG)** based on the **miles driven** and **gallons used**. The program continuously prompts the user for inputs and displays the MPG for each trip until the user enters `-1` to exit.

## Features
- Calculates **MPG for each trip**  
- Uses a **loop** to allow multiple entries  
- Includes **error handling** to prevent division by zero  

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/acallo21/AIT500-Projects.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:  
   ```sh
   cd AIT500-Projects/Gas-Mileage-Calculator
   ```
3. Open the project in **Eclipse** or any Java IDE.  
4. Run the **`GasMileage.java`** file.

## Example Output
```
Enter miles driven (-1 to end): 200 
Enter gallons used: 10 
Your MPG total is: 20

Enter miles driven (-1 to end): 300 
Enter gallons used: 15 
Your MPG total is: 20

Enter miles driven (-1 to end): -1 
Application finished.
```

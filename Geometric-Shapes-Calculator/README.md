# Geometric Shapes Calculator

## Description
This Java program calculates the **area and perimeter** of different geometric shapes (**Circle, Square, and Triangle**). The program uses **inheritance and polymorphism**, allowing each shape to implement its own calculation methods.

## Features
- Implements **object-oriented programming (OOP)** with **abstract classes**  
- Supports **Circle, Square, and Triangle**  
- Calculates **area and perimeter** for each shape  
- Uses a **single array** to store different shape objects and process them dynamically  

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/acallo21/AIT500-Projects.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:  
   ```sh
   cd AIT500-Projects/Geometric-Shapes-Calculator
   ```
3. Open the project in **Eclipse** or any Java IDE.  
4. Run the **`TestShapes.java`** file.

## Example Output
```
Shape: Circle Area: 22.027 Perimeter: 16.652

Shape: Square Area: 47.61 Perimeter: 27.6

Shape: Triangle Area: 28.43 Perimeter: 24.3
```

# Bubble Sort Algorithm

## Description
This Java program implements the **Bubble Sort algorithm** to sort an array of random integers in ascending order. The program repeatedly swaps adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order until the entire array is sorted.

## Features
- Uses **Bubble Sort** to sort an array  
- Generates **random integers** for the array  
- Demonstrates **sorting algorithm mechanics**  
- Includes a test file to verify sorting  

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/acallo21/AIT500-Projects.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:  
   ```sh
   cd AIT500-Projects/Bubble-Sort-Algorithm
   ```
3. Open the project in **Eclipse** or any Java IDE.  
4. Run the **`BubbleSortTest.java`** file.

## Example Output
```
Unsorted Array: [43, 12, 89, 34, 55, 67, 2, 78, 10, 23] 
Sorted Array: [2, 10, 12, 23, 34, 43, 55, 67, 78, 89]
```
